 Our experience with the Connectic Cut was only positive. We are launched in the project with very little knowledge on solar energy, and we are not even sure that the solarization of our home will bring enough advantage to compensate the initial cost. But the people of the Connectic Cut have formed us. In technology, they have affected many of the calculations and proposed several scenarios. They have inspired us to trust the first day and have continued to impress us with their excellent client service. Every time we look at the current situation around the world, we know that we have done the right choice.
