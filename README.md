Ever since the launch of ChatGPT and the release of new modeling languages by OpenAI in 2022, there has been a growing interest within the wider tech community to explore the potential of multiple applications of generative AI in software and web development. In this course, join instructor Sandy Ludosky to get up to speed quickly with the latest tools and technologies, with hands-on training and exercise challenges along the way.

Learn how to use generative AI to create next-generation Python applications including your own chatbot application. Sandy shows you how to start experimenting with other generative models such as DALL-E and the Whisper Audio API as well as how to extend LLM capabilities with function calling and build a custom-knowledge chatbot using LangChain, embeddings, and ChromaDB.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
